**Ball Racing Desktop Client**

A simple game that races 4 random balls against each other. 
This repo includes 2 versions, one in vanilla processing and one in python processing.
Both projects were tested within the processing IDE so may have issues when ran elsewhere.
.properties files are not included. Based on an older project present on both my githubs called ball racing which is 
written in the Javascript version of processing. these versions do contain optimizations.
